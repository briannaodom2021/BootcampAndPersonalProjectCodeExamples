<em>Week 3:</em>
<a href="https://github.com/briannaodom2021/Bootcamp_CodeExamples/blob/main/helloworld_javascript/theater.html"> Assignment 6 </a> was javascript practice making a separate js folder. We took in user inputs for a fake movie showing in order to tell them what the price of their ticket would be. If they saw a matinee it would be $3 cheaper on their ticket. If they were ages 12 to 65 their tickets were orignally $20. Otherwise the person's ticket was $10. These prices are without the discount. 

My code handled checking if user input was valid i.e. was actually a number for age and if the user typed yes (y) or no (n).
